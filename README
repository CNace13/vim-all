vim-all-cmd plugin

Overview
---------------------

This plug-in is the result of a long search to replicate ve's "all"
command in vim.


What is provided
------------------------

The plug-in provides two global commands:

    :All <pattern>
    :EAll <pattern>

(The only difference between All and EAll is that All uses grep to filter lines
while EAll uses egrep.  Therefore, for patterns with complex regular
expression, use EAll instead of All.)

And the following functions, which are commonly called through a map (see
examples).

    GetSeqNum()    Extracts sequence number from current line
    GetCmdAdr()    Extracts Address from current line
    GetField(num)  Returns *num* white-space delimited field on current line


Advantages relative to ve
----------------------------------------------------

    0. access to full vim/gvim functionality :)
    1. multiple "all" windows may be open at the same time (without manually
    renaming)
    2. search buffers are named after the search pattern
    3. search buffers are scratch buffers


Similarities to ve
----------------------------------------------------

    1. search buffers have the same syntax highlighting applied
    2. Ctrl-Q is mapped to jump back and forth between original file and the
    last all search buffer.
